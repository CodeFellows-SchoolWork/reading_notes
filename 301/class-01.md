## **Component Based Architecture**

### **What is a component?**

>A component is like an ingredient of a cooking recipe,  
On it's own an ingredient has only a few uses but when combined with a recipe it's uses are endless,  
Like an ingredient a component on its own only contains a small pice of the overall puzzle,  
However unlike a puzzle pice or an ingredient a component can be reused as many times as needed in order to create the desired result such as a react web app,  
This is because a component is like a small cog in a watch,  
It continuously does the same thing but the results are always different as you are able to change the data provided to your component whilst maintaining the same functionality,

### **What are the characteristics of a component?**

#### Component Characteristics Are-  

> **Reusability**   
This is because usually a component is written like a mathematic formula it cares more about the process of steps then the information used or displayed,

> **Replaceable**    
Once it has done it's job the component can be replaced with a different component,  
This makes things feel and flow much better and creates a better user experience,

> **Not context specific**   
A component is designed to work in different environment for instance a Web App or a Mobile App,

> **Extensible**    
A Component can be used within other components to add more features and function,

> **Encapsulated**   
A Component encapsulates the process and only displays the desired output, Meaning you can use the functional properties of a component but you can't see how it's being generated,

> **Independent**    
A Component should not need another component to work as they should be designed to be used as a complete solution.

### **What are the advantages of using component based architecture?**

>I'm sure my reasoning will change over time but because of how my brain works i like components as everything is compartmentalized and is used to build the desired user interface.

## **What Are Props And How To Use Them In React**

### **What is props short for?**

>Props is a short hand way of saying properties,

### **How are props used in React?**

>Props can be used like passing arguments to a function,

### **What is the flow of props?**

>One way is the flow of props in react so a Parent -> Child.
